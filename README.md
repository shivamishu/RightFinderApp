**Application is hosted on AWS platform with below Architecture**: 

● EC2 and AMI: Create the EC2 instance and install NodeJS. Create a snapshot, AMI of EC2 instance with all the required configurations. This AMI will be used by EC2 instances when it gets spawned by Auto scaling policies.


● Auto-Scaling Group: Configure the required auto scaling policy to make the system highly-available and highly scalable with min desired instance as 1 and max instance of 2. These configs could be changed anytime as per the requirements.


● Elastic Load Balancer: An Application(HTTP HTTPS) load balancer manages the traffic efficiently. They distribute incoming application traffic load across multiple EC2 instances hosted in multiple Availability Zones. We can have one or more listeners attached to our load balancer to increase application’s availability.


● S3: S3 (with Standard S3 storage class) is used to store employee images


● Cross Region Data Replication: To implement DR, we have used Data Replication of S3 to have Cross Region Replication accommodating fault tolerance. We could also use Disaster Recovery for fault tolerance.


● CloudFront: We used Amazon CloudFront to reduce the unnecessary traffic back to S3 origin to help improve latency as well as reduce load on the origin. It caches our content and provides faster access globally. 


● Transfer Acceleration for S3 Bucket: Transfer Acceleration will take advantage of itsglobally distributed edge locations. When the data arrives at the nearest edge location, it is routed to automatically internally by Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.


● RDS: All the user database is stored here and connected to Tableau for analytics. Currently using RDS on MySQL engine.


● Route 53: Registered our domain on Route53 and configured the hosted zones and created records and added record names with various routing policies using dual stack load balancer redirecting all traffic to HTTPS(installed SSL certificates using Certificate Manager (ACM)).


● CloudWatch: It is used to log and monitor the auto scaling, EC2,S3 bucket logs etc SNS is used for sending various above notifications using messages, emails and logs.


● Amazon Cognito: We have created a user pool for all our admin users to accommodate the access to application and APIs using Cognito Hosted UI for sign and sign up using 2FA and also added social identity providers like Facebook.


● Third Party Integration: We used LinkedIn for third party integration, where employee could import his profile picture from his/her LinkedIn Profile.


● Jenkins: Used Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline:


● Tableau: Integrating with Tableau to track skill sets and check employee availability for a particular skill set.


● Used OpenUI5 with bootstrap to build UI. It is an open source Model View Controller based JavaScript Framework. For Backend, we used NodeJS.
